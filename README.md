# Simple Linear Regression

## Simple linear regression examples.

Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.

### Example 1: Simple linear regression of a beta distribution.
             * Dataset of a sample of size *n* that follows the beta distribution;
             * Histogram for different combinations of parameters of a beta distribution;
             * Plot of the beta probability density function;
             * Likelihood function;
             * Log-likelihood function;
             * Score function;
             * Fisher information;
             * Hypothesis testing: Likelihood Ratio statistics, Wald statistic, Test statistics score, Parameter estimation (BFGS-B method), Likelihood ratio test, Wald's Test, Wald test for probability distribution with more than one parameter, Test Score;
             * Confidence interval;
             * Plot log-likelihood function.
