# Simple Linear Regression
## Simple linear regression examples.

### Example 1: Simple linear regression of a beta distribution.
             * Dataset of a sample of size *n* that follows the beta distribution;
             * Histogram for different combinations of parameters of a beta distribution;
             * Plot of the beta probability density function;
             * Likelihood function;
             * Log-likelihood function;
             * Score function;
             * Fisher information;
             * **Hypothesis testing:** Likelihood Ratio statistics, Wald statistic, Test statistics score, Parameter estimation (BFGS-B method), Likelihood ratio test, Wald's Test, Wald test for probability distribution with more than one parameter, Test Score;
             * Confidence interval;
             * Plot log-likelihood function.
