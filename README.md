# Simple Linear Regression

In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.[1][2][3][4][5] That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor.

## Simple linear regression examples.

### Example 1: Simple linear regression of a beta distribution.
             * Dataset of a sample of size *n* that follows the beta distribution;
             * Histogram for different combinations of parameters of a beta distribution;
             * Plot of the beta probability density function;
             * Likelihood function;
             * Log-likelihood function;
             * Score function;
             * Fisher information;
             * Hypothesis testing: Likelihood Ratio statistics, Wald statistic, Test statistics score, Parameter estimation (BFGS-B method), Likelihood ratio test, Wald's Test, Wald test for probability distribution with more than one parameter, Test Score;
             * Confidence interval;
             * Plot log-likelihood function.
